# CritiQA: A Swanky Platform for Secure Surveys and Community Engagement

CritiQA is a sophisticated platform that offers a delightful and engaging experience for creating and participating in surveys while fostering community involvement. With a touch of personalization, a sprinkle of POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) rewards, and a garnish of data-cleaning, it's the perfect recipe for meaningful interactions. We've also added an extra layer of security by utilizing the iExec blockchain to store survey responses privately.
